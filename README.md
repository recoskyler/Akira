# Akira

Akira is a Chrome extension for sorting -> viewing -> bookmarking/closing a bunch of tabs open on multiple windows. If you are the type who does not close any Chrome tabs, and just opens a new window instead, you can Akira to view all open tabs, sort them by window/name/site/age/tag, then close unnecessary, and bookmark necessary ones.
