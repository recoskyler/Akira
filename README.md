# Akira

Akira is a Chrome extension for sorting -> viewing -> bookmarking/closing a bunch of tabs open on multiple windows. If you are the type who does not close any Chrome tabs, and opens a new window instead, you can use Akira to view all open tabs, group them by window/site, sort them alphabetically, then close the unnecessary, and bookmark the necessary ones.
