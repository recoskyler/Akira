Akira is a Google Chrome extension for sorting -> viewing -> bookmarking/closing a bunch of tabs open on multiple windows. If you are the type who does not close any Chrome tabs, and opens a new window instead, you can use Akira to view all open tabs, group them by window/site, sort them alphabetically, then close the unnecessary, and bookmark the necessary ones.

[Session Buddy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/session-buddy/edacconmaakjimmfgnblocblbcdcpbko) may be a better option if you want to manage your tabs, but Akira is just a project I developed to improve my skills, so I recommend you give Session Buddy a try first. (Not sponsored or anything, just saw it on Chrome Web Store, and thought it was cool)
