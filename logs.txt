24/01/2020 21:45 | As the time was limited, I was able to recharged my 'Deniz Battery', for just 45 minutes, to 30 percent. It should be sufficient for at least 30 days.
25/01/2020 13:20 | I started my journey to the coordinates 59.394710, 24.651891 at 09:40. After 4 hours, I arrived at the designated coordinates. My 'Deniz Battery' level is 28 percent. I am not sure if this amount will be sufficient for 29 more days.

30/01/2020 23:-- : as I saw the level drop to 4 percent, i started writing my will, and praying to gods that i didnt believe in. there is no '4 more days', only hours left.
